The idea for this app is to simultaneously capture game controller inputs and a video stream for the purposes of supporting user-created mechanical drills/trials. Planned features include:

* Capture a simultaneous recording of controller inputs and video.
* Visualize the inputs over the screen recording as a kind of Demonstration
* An input display overlay with a visual representation of timing (think Dance Dance Revolution/Guitar Hero). The background of this overlay should be transparent (adjustable opacity?) so it can be viewied on top of the game client.
* Pulse the input display with user inputs to provide timing feedback.
* Long term goal: an editor for cleaning the input recording


Supporting libraries:
kivy: This is supposedly a very easy gui framework for python. Let's find out.
pygame: This is the go-to for python game stuff. Game input recording is a small component of that but maybe we can find more things to use.
